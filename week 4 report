This week i thank to get a lot as following 

HOW TO WIN MACHINE LEARNING COMPETITION 
Here from video i learn the basic concept of competition where in every compition there is following to know about which are 
  1 Data 
  there is different format csv file,text file,database data ,photo so one must know how data is structure and to know the features to extract
  2 model 
  Must know to design your model well by knowing diferent metrics that will make your model to do best
  3 submission
  here you must know how you can submit your result to competition 
  4 evaluation
  here you must know how to evaluate your model by activation funtion and know the performance of your model and increase the performance
  as possible
  
  
I get to know that there is different between real life problem and competition, real word problem is comprecated compare to compitition
,in real life problem there is following to consider when you tacke real life problem
 
  1.  Understanding of business problem
  2.  Problem formalization
  3.  Data collection
  4.  Data preprocessing
  5.  Modelling
  6.  Way to eveluate model in real life
  7.  way to deploy model
 
I get to know before anything you must understand your data well  also different technique that can be used in exproratory data analysis 
and way to look in a vitualization of data and to know what is meant in different graph from your data

I learn the following 
1. Validation help us to evaluate quality of model 
2. Help us to select the model which will perform well to unseen data
3. Underfiting refer not capturing enough pattern in data
4. Overfiting refer to captioning noise on data or caption the pattern which do not generalize the test data

I got to know there is three validation strategy which are
 1. holdout
 2. KFold
 3 LOO
 
 I got to know different metrics that is used in different model and how i can optimize different metrics so as to improve the 
 performance of my model 
 
 I got to know different regulization technique 
  1. CV loop inside training data 
  2. Smoothing
  3. Adding random noise
  4. Sorting and calculating random mean
  
  I got to know hyperparameter in general and different hyperparameter that are used in different models and how to tune 
  those hyperparameter to increase the performance of model 
  
  Also i get to know ensembel method which is way to combining different machine learning model to get better prediction so i can join different 
  machine learning model to get better prediction on my system 
  
  FAST AI 
  Also i got to know fastai provide framework where i can use the model that alredy build using fastai and not to build my own model 
  from scratch  
  
  Generally 
  I learn machine learning is not all about take code and using it but to know what is meaning of what i supposed to do .Also i must 
  understand how to improve my model and get maximum performance of model when deployed in real world environment .I appriciate a lot 
  for this wonderful field that i have ever done be blessed sir to dedicate your self on to us....
